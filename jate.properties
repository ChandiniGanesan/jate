# Value type: string
# Def: What is the name of the field you want to use to keep all 
# n-grams of each document. This field also stores information
# such as offsets, and frequency. These n-grams are a superset

# Value type: string matching the dynamic field syntax in solr
# Def: A solr dynamic field patten used to match a particular
# part (usually structural) a document, e.g., title, links, first
# paragraph etc. Such fields are defined and required by each 
# individual ATR algorithm. These fields are processed by JATE to 
# extract and store terms. They are not indexed. They only provide 
# a way to trace the part of a document that a term is found. Such 
# information can be used by some ATR algorithms. However most ATR
# algorithms do not use such information.
#
# This must match dynamic fields defined in your existing schema
